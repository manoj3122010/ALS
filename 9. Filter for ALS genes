# `als_genes` is a tibble containing ALS-related genes obtained from the OpenTargets platform.
# It includes attributes such as the gene symbol and overall association score with ALS.
# Additionally, it provides information on genetic associations, somatic mutations, drugs targeting the genes,
# pathways/systems biology relevance, text mining evidence, RNA expression, and more.

# Combine upregulated genes from Exc_neuron, Inh_neuron, and Non_neuron into a single list
up <- c(exc_up_genes, inh_up_genes, non_up_genes)

# Create a data frame with the upregulated genes
up <- data.frame(symbol = up)

# Filter ALS genes that are upregulated
als_up <- als_genes %>%
     semi_join(up, by = "symbol")

# Combine downregulated genes from Exc_neuron, Inh_neuron, and Non_neuron into a single list
down <- c(exc_down_genes, inh_down_genes, non_down_genes)

# Create a data frame with the downregulated genes
down <- data.frame(symbol = down)

# Filter ALS genes that are downregulated
als_down <- als_genes %>%
     semi_join(down, by = "symbol")

# Find common genes between upregulated and downregulated ALS genes
als_common <- intersect(als_up$symbol, als_down$symbol)

# Create a data frame with the common genes
common <- data.frame(symbol = als_common)

# Filter ALS genes that are common between upregulated and downregulated
als_common <- als_genes %>%
     semi_join(common, by = "symbol")

# Write the filtered ALS genes to Excel files
write.xlsx(als_up, file = "als_up.xlsx", row.names = FALSE)
write.xlsx(als_down, file = "als_down.xlsx", row.names = FALSE)
